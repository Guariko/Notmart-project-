            <p>“We used to do everything. Lectures, on-site courses,
                and even onsite projects with companies. We would work
                so many hours, visit clients, schools, and companies.
                Right when we launched our online
                training with Hotmart, we felt the difference.”</p>

                is definitely one of the most complete. We have add

                for so long, many have been completely solved by Hotmart.”
