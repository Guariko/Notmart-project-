                <h3>How can I sell in other countries using notmart's payment system?</h3>
                <span class="show__answer"></span>
            </div>

            <p class="answer">For international sales, the product&#39;s
                price is automatically converted into the local currency, and the buyer is offered local payment methods.
                In other words, notmart Payments not only automates the details of currency conversion
                and local taxes from end-to-end, but also gives your potential customers
                options to pay the way they feel most
                comfortable - which means higher
                chances of conversion!</p>

                <h3>Will notmart own my product?</h3>
                <span class="show__answer"></span>
            </div>
            <p class="answer">
                Depending on the country, only for a few seconds! Let us explain.

                notmart makes selling digital products around
                the world easy. To do this, we have to comply with lots
                of regulations in many different locations. For some countries,
                this involves notmart working as a reseller. This means that when
                a purchase is made, notmart buys the product from the creator and
                resells it to the buyer seconds later.

                Do we end up owning your product?
                No! Acting as a reseller is only a question of complying
                with the law. Do we ever claim creative rights to what you&#39;re selling?
                Never! Will we control the way you market and price your product like
                other online platforms? Not a chance!

                notmart respects the creator as the
                sole owner of their work and business. You have the freedom
                to control and sell your products as you see fit.
